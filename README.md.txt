## 🎯 Project Objective

Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan should be **approved** or **rejected**, based on customer financial details.

Model pattern:
- Input → Applicant financial details  
- Output → Loan Approved (1) or Not Approved (0)

## 📅 Week 1 – Development Plan

**Day 1:** Project setup, dataset downloading, folder creation, environment setup.  
**Day 2:** Data cleaning (missing values, outliers, formatting).  
**Day 3:** Exploratory Data Analysis (graphs, distributions, insights).  
**Day 4:** Feature Engineering + Preprocessing (encoding, new features).  
**Day 5:** Train ML Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
**Day 6:** Model tuning, accuracy improvement, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC.  
**Day 7:** Export final model (`final_model.pkl`) + documentation.

## 📈 Final Output

- Cleaned dataset  
- Fully trained ML model (`final_model.pkl`)  
- Evaluation metrics + plots  
- Ready for API deployment (Week 2)
