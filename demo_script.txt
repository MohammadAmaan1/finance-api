Demo Script - Loan Approval Prediction API

Hi, my name is Mohammad Amaan.
This is my Loan Approval Prediction API built using Machine Learning and FastAPI.

Features:
- Live loan approval prediction using ML model
- Health check endpoint
- Model info endpoint
- JSON-based prediction endpoint

Steps in demo:
1. Open /health to show server is running
2. Open /info to show model metadata
3. Use Postman to send /predict request
4. Show Approved/Rejected response with probability

This API is deployed on Render and can be integrated into websites, dashboards, or mobile apps.
Thank you.
